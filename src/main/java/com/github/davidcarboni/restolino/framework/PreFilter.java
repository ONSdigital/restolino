/**
 * Implement this interface if you need to get access to requests before they
 * are handled by Restolino.
 * <p>
 * This enables you to do things like add cache headers to static requests.
 * <p>
 * This interface is named {@link PreFilter} because it provides similar
 * functionality to a Servlet filter, however there are important differences.
 * Restolino doesn't offer a "chain" of filters. Implementations of this class
 * will be called on each request but the order is not guaranteed.
 * <p>
 * The intention is to minimise the convenience of filtering in order to
 * discourage design leakage away from {@link Api} classes (thereby removing a
 * barrier to increased complexity). The aim is to encourage having zero, or, at
 * most one implementation to do things that absolutely can't be done by an
 * {@link Api} - such as setting headers on non-api requests.
